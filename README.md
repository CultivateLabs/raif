# Setup

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "raif"
```

And then execute:
```bash
bundle install
```

Run the install generator:
```bash
rails generate raif:install
```

This will:
- Create a configuration file at `config/initializers/raif.rb`
- Copy Raif's database migrations to your application
- Mount Raif's engine at `/raif` in your application's `config/routes.rb` file

You must configure at least one API key for your LLM provider ([OpenAI](#openai), [Anthropic Claude](#anthropic-claude), [AWS Bedrock](#aws-bedrock-claude), [OpenRouter](#openrouter)). By default, the initializer will load them from environment variables (e.g. `ENV["OPENAI_API_KEY"]`, `ENV["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]`, `ENV["OPENROUTER_API_KEY"]`). Alternatively, you can set them directly in `config/initializers/raif.rb`.

Run the migrations. Raif is compatible with both PostgreSQL and MySQL databases.
```bash
rails db:migrate
```

If you plan to use the [conversations](#conversations) feature or Raif's [web admin](#web-admin), configure authentication and authorization for Raif's controllers in `config/initializers/raif.rb`:

```ruby
Raif.configure do |config|
  # Configure who can access non-admin controllers
  # For example, to allow all logged in users:
  config.authorize_controller_action = ->{ current_user.present? }

  # Configure who can access admin controllers
  # For example, to allow users with admin privileges:
  config.authorize_admin_controller_action = ->{ current_user&.admin? }
end
```

Configure your LLM providers. You'll need at least one of:

## OpenAI

Raif supports both OpenAI's [Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) and the newer [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses), which provides access to provider-managed tools like web search, code execution, and image generation.

### OpenAI Completions API
```ruby
Raif.configure do |config|
  config.open_ai_models_enabled = true
  config.open_ai_api_key = ENV["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
  config.default_llm_model_key = "open_ai_gpt_4o"
end
```

Currently supported OpenAI Completions API models:
- `open_ai_gpt_4o_mini`
- `open_ai_gpt_4o`
- `open_ai_gpt_3_5_turbo`
- `open_ai_gpt_4_1`
- `open_ai_gpt_4_1_mini`
- `open_ai_gpt_4_1_nano`
- `open_ai_o1`
- `open_ai_o1_mini`
- `open_ai_o3`

### OpenAI Responses API
```ruby
Raif.configure do |config|
  config.open_ai_models_enabled = true
  config.open_ai_api_key = ENV["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
  config.default_llm_model_key = "open_ai_responses_gpt_4o"
end
```

Currently supported OpenAI Responses API models:
- `open_ai_responses_gpt_4o_mini`
- `open_ai_responses_gpt_4o`
- `open_ai_responses_gpt_3_5_turbo`

- `open_ai_responses_o3`
- `open_ai_responses_o3_mini`
- `open_ai_responses_o3_pro`
- `open_ai_responses_o4_mini`

The Responses API provides access to [provider-managed tools](#provider-managed-tools), including web search, code execution, and image generation.

## Anthropic Claude
```ruby
Raif.configure do |config|
  config.anthropic_models_enabled = true
  config.anthropic_api_key = ENV["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"]
  config.default_llm_model_key = "anthropic_claude_3_5_sonnet"
end
```

Currently supported Anthropic models:
- `anthropic_claude_3_7_sonnet`
- `anthropic_claude_3_5_sonnet`
- `anthropic_claude_3_5_haiku`
- `anthropic_claude_3_opus`

The Anthropic adapter provides access to [provider-managed tools](#provider-managed-tools) for web search and code execution.

## AWS Bedrock (Claude)
```ruby
Raif.configure do |config|
  config.bedrock_models_enabled = true
  config.aws_bedrock_region = "us-east-1"
  config.default_llm_model_key = "bedrock_claude_3_5_sonnet"
end
```

Currently supported Bedrock models:
- `bedrock_claude_3_5_sonnet`
- `bedrock_claude_3_7_sonnet`
- `bedrock_claude_3_5_haiku`
- `bedrock_claude_3_opus`
- `bedrock_amazon_nova_micro`
- `bedrock_amazon_nova_lite`
- `bedrock_amazon_nova_pro`

Note: Raif utilizes the [AWS Bedrock gem](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/BedrockRuntime/Client.html) and AWS credentials should be configured via the AWS SDK (environment variables, IAM role, etc.)

## OpenRouter
[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) is a unified API that provides access to multiple AI models from different providers including Anthropic, Meta, Google, and more.

```ruby
Raif.configure do |config|
  config.open_router_models_enabled = true
  config.open_router_api_key = ENV["OPENROUTER_API_KEY"]
  config.open_router_app_name = "Your App Name" # Optional
  config.open_router_site_url = "https://yourdomain.com" # Optional
  config.default_llm_model_key = "open_router_claude_3_7_sonnet"
end
```

Currently included OpenRouter models:
- `open_router_claude_3_7_sonnet`
- `open_router_llama_3_3_70b_instruct`
- `open_router_llama_3_1_8b_instruct`
- `open_router_llama_4_maverick`
- `open_router_llama_4_scout`
- `open_router_gemini_2_0_flash`
- `open_router_deepseek_chat_v3`

See [Adding LLM Models](#adding-llm-models) for more information on adding new OpenRouter models.

# Chatting with the LLM

When using Raif, it's often useful to use one of the [higher level abstractions](#key-raif-concepts) in your application. But when needed, you can utilize `Raif::Llm` to chat with the model directly. All calls to the LLM will create and return a `Raif::ModelCompletion` record, providing you a log of all interactions with the LLM which can be viewed in the [web admin](#web-admin).

Call `Raif::Llm#chat` with either a `message` string or `messages` array.:
```ruby
llm = Raif.llm(:open_ai_gpt_4o) # will return a Raif::Llm instance
model_completion = llm.chat(message: "Hello")
puts model_completion.raw_response
# => "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
```

The `Raif::ModelCompletion` class will handle parsing the response for you, should you ask for a different response format (which can be one of `:html`, `:text`, or `:json`). You can also provide a `system_prompt` to the `chat` method:
```ruby
llm = Raif.llm(:open_ai_gpt_4o)
messages = [
  { role: "user", content: "Hello" },
  { role: "assistant", content: "Hello! How can I assist you today?" },
  { role: "user", content: "Can you you tell me a joke?" },
]

system_prompt = "You are a helpful assistant who specializes in telling jokes. Your response should be a properly formatted JSON object containing a single `joke` key. Do not include any other text in your response outside the JSON object."

model_completion = llm.chat(messages: messages, response_format: :json, system_prompt: system_prompt)
puts model_completion.raw_response
# => `​`​`json
# => {
# =>   "joke": "Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts."
# => }
# => `​`​`

puts model_completion.parsed_response # will strip backticks, parse the JSON, and give you a Ruby hash
# => {"joke" => "Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts."}
```

## Streaming Responses

You can enable streaming for any chat call by passing a block to the `chat` method. When streaming is enabled, the block will be called with partial responses as they're received from the LLM:

```ruby
llm = Raif.llm(:open_ai_gpt_4o)
model_completion = llm.chat(message: "Tell me a story") do |model_completion, delta, sse_event|
  # This block is called multiple times as the response streams in.
  # You could broadcast these updates via Turbo Streams, WebSockets, etc.
  Turbo::StreamsChannel.broadcast_replace_to(
    :my_channel,
    target: "chat-response",
    partial: "my_partial_displaying_chat_response",
    locals: { model_completion: model_completion, delta: delta, sse_event: sse_event }
  )
end

# The final complete response is available in the model_completion
puts model_completion.raw_response
```

You can configure the streaming update frequency by adjusting the chunk size threshold in your Raif configuration:

```ruby
Raif.configure do |config|
  # Control how often the model completion is updated & the block is called when streaming.
  # Lower values = more frequent updates but more database writes.
  # Higher values = less frequent updates but fewer database writes.
  config.streaming_update_chunk_size_threshold = 50 # default is 25
end
```

# Key Raif Concepts

## Tasks
If you have a single-shot task that you want an LLM to do in your application, you should create a `Raif::Task` subclass, where you'll define the prompt and response format for the task and call via `Raif::Task.run`. For example, say you have a `Document` model in your app and want to have a summarization task for the LLM:

```bash
rails generate raif:task DocumentSummarization --response-format html
```

This will create a new task in `app/models/raif/tasks/document_summarization.rb`:

```ruby
class Raif::Tasks::DocumentSummarization < Raif::ApplicationTask
  llm_response_format :html # options are :html, :text, :json
  llm_temperature 0.8 # optional, defaults to 0.7
  llm_response_allowed_tags %w[p b i div strong] # optional, defaults to Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags
  llm_response_allowed_attributes %w[style] # optional, defaults to Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_attributes

  # Any attr_accessor you define can be included as an argument when calling `run`. 
  # E.g. Raif::Tasks::DocumentSummarization.run(document: document, creator: user)
  attr_accessor :document
  
  def build_system_prompt
    sp = "You are an assistant with expertise in summarizing detailed articles into clear and concise language."
    sp += system_prompt_language_preference if requested_language_key.present?
    sp
  end

  def build_prompt
    <<~PROMPT
      Consider the following information:

      Title: #{document.title}
      Text:
      ```
      #{document.content}
      ```

      Your task is to read the provided article and associated information, and summarize the article concisely and clearly in approximately 1 paragraph. Your summary should include all of the key points, views, and arguments of the text, and should only include facts referenced in the text directly. Do not add any inferences, speculations, or analysis of your own, and do not exaggerate or overstate facts. If you quote directly from the article, include quotation marks.

      Format your response using basic HTML tags.

      If the text does not appear to represent the title, please return the text "#{summarization_failure_text}" and nothing else.
    PROMPT
  end

end
```

And then run the task (typically via a background job):
```
document = Document.first # assumes your app defines a Document model
user = User.first # assumes your app defines a User model
task = Raif::Tasks::DocumentSummarization.run(document: document, creator: user)
summary = task.parsed_response
```

### JSON Response Format Tasks

If you want to use a JSON response format for your task, you can do so by setting the `llm_response_format` to `:json` in your task subclass. If you're using OpenAI, this will set the response to use [JSON mode](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs?api-mode=chat#json-mode). You can also define a JSON schema, which will then trigger utilization of OpenAI's [structured outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs?api-mode=chat#structured-outputs) feature. If you're using Claude, it will create a tool for Claude to use to generate a JSON response.

```bash
rails generate raif:task WebSearchQueryGeneration --response-format json
```

This will create a new task in `app/models/raif/tasks/web_search_query_generation.rb`:

```ruby
module Raif
  module Tasks
    class WebSearchQueryGeneration < Raif::ApplicationTask
      llm_response_format :json

      attr_accessor :topic

      json_response_schema do
        array :queries do
          items type: "string"
        end
      end

      def build_prompt
        <<~PROMPT
          Generate a list of 3 search queries that I can use to find information about the following topic:
          #{topic}

          Format your response as JSON.
        PROMPT
      end
    end
  end
end

```

### Task Language Preference
You can also pass in a `requested_language_key` to the `run` method. When this is provided, Raif will add a line to the system prompt requesting that the LLM respond in the specified language:
```
task = Raif::Tasks::DocumentSummarization.run(document: document, creator: user, requested_language_key: "es")
```

Would produce a system prompt that looks like this:
```
You are an assistant with expertise in summarizing detailed articles into clear and concise language.
You're collaborating with teammate who speaks Spanish. Please respond in Spanish.
```

The current list of valid language keys can be found [here](https://github.com/CultivateLabs/raif/blob/main/lib/raif/languages.rb).

## Conversations

Raif provides `Raif::Conversation` and `Raif::ConversationEntry` models that you can use to  provide an LLM-powered chat interface. It also provides controllers and views for the conversation interface.

This feature utilizes Turbo Streams, Stimulus controllers, and ActiveJob, so your application must have those set up first. 

To use it in your application, first set up the css and javascript in your application. In the `<head>` section of your layout file:
```erb
<%= stylesheet_link_tag "raif" %>
```

In an app using import maps, add the following to your `application.js` file:
```js
import "raif"
```

In a controller serving the conversation view:
```ruby
class ExampleConversationController < ApplicationController
  def show
    @conversation = Raif::Conversation.where(creator: current_user).order(created_at: :desc).first

    if @conversation.nil?
      @conversation = Raif::Conversation.new(creator: current_user)
      @conversation.save!
    end
  end
end
```

And then in the view where you'd like to display the conversation interface:
```erb
<%= raif_conversation(@conversation) %>
```

If your app already includes Bootstrap styles, this will render a conversation interface that looks something like:

![Conversation Interface](./screenshots/conversation-interface.png)

If your app does not include Bootstrap, you can [override the views](#views) to update styles.

### Real-time Streaming Responses

Raif conversations have built-in support for streaming responses, where the LLM's response is displayed progressively as it's being generated. Each time a conversation entry is updated during the streaming response, Raif will call `broadcast_replace_to(conversation)` (where `conversation` is the `Raif::Conversation` associated with the conversation entry). When using the `raif_conversation` view helper, it will automatically set up the subscription for you.

### Conversation Types

If your application has a specific type of conversation that you use frequently, you can create a custom conversation type by running the generator. For example, say you are implementing a customer support chatbot in your application and want to have a custom conversation type for doing this with the LLM:
```bash
rails generate raif:conversation CustomerSupport
```

This will create a new conversation type in `app/models/raif/conversations/customer_support.rb`.

You can then customize the system prompt, initial message, and available [model tools](#model-tools) for that conversation type:

```ruby
class Raif::Conversations::CustomerSupport < Raif::Conversation
  before_create -> { 
    self.available_model_tools = [
      "Raif::ModelTools::SearchKnowledgeBase",
      "Raif::ModelTools::FileSupportTicket" 
    ]
  }

  def system_prompt_intro
    <<~PROMPT
      You are a helpful assistant who specializes in customer support. You're working with a customer who is experiencing an issue with your product.
    PROMPT
  end

  def initial_chat_message
    I18n.t("#{self.class.name.underscore.gsub("/", ".")}.initial_chat_message")
  end
end
```


## Agents

Raif also provides `Raif::Agents::ReActAgent`, which implements a ReAct-style agent loop using [tool calls](#model-tools):

```ruby
# Create a new agent
agent = Raif::Agents::ReActAgent.new(
  task: "Research the history of the Eiffel Tower",
  available_model_tools: [Raif::ModelTools::WikipediaSearch, Raif::ModelTools::FetchUrl],
  creator: current_user
)

# Run the agent and get the final answer
final_answer = agent.run!

# Or run the agent and monitor its progress
agent.run! do |conversation_history_entry|
  Turbo::StreamsChannel.broadcast_append_to(
    :my_agent_channel,
    target: "agent-progress",
    partial: "my_partial_displaying_agent_progress",
    locals: { agent: agent, conversation_history_entry: conversation_history_entry }
  )
end
```

On each step of the agent loop, an entry will be added to the `Raif::Agent#conversation_history` and, if you pass a block to the `run!` method, the block will be called with the `conversation_history_entry` as an argument. You can use this to monitor and display the agent's progress in real-time.

The conversation_history_entry will be a hash with "role" and "content" keys:
```ruby
{
  "role" => "assistant",
  "content" => "a message here"
}
```

### Creating Custom Agents

You can create custom agents using the generator:
```bash
rails generate raif:agent WikipediaResearchAgent
```

This will create a new agent in `app/models/raif/agents/wikipedia_research_agent.rb`:

```ruby
module Raif
  module Agents
    class WikipediaResearchAgent < Raif::Agent
      # If you want to always include a certain set of model tools with this agent type,
      # uncomment this callback to populate the available_model_tools attribute with your desired model tools.
      # before_create -> {
      #   self.available_model_tools ||= [
      #     Raif::ModelTools::WikipediaSearchTool,
      #     Raif::ModelTools::FetchUrlTool
      #   ]
      # }

      # Enter your agent's system prompt here. Alternatively, you can change your agent's superclass
      # to an existing agent types (like Raif::Agents::ReActAgent) to utilize an existing system prompt.
      def build_system_prompt
        # TODO: Implement your system prompt here
      end

      # Each iteration of the agent loop will generate a new Raif::ModelCompletion record and
      # then call this method with it as an argument.
      def process_iteration_model_completion(model_completion)
        # TODO: Implement your iteration processing here
      end
    end
  end
end

```

## Model Tools

Raif provides a `Raif::ModelTool` base class that you can use to create custom tools for your agents and conversations. [`Raif::ModelTools::WikipediaSearch`](https://github.com/CultivateLabs/raif/blob/main/app/models/raif/model_tools/wikipedia_search.rb) and [`Raif::ModelTools::FetchUrl`](https://github.com/CultivateLabs/raif/blob/main/app/models/raif/model_tools/fetch_url.rb) tools are included as examples.

You can create your own model tools to provide to the LLM using the generator:
```bash
rails generate raif:model_tool GoogleSearch
```

This will create a new model tool in `app/models/raif/model_tools/google_search.rb`:

```ruby
class Raif::ModelTools::GoogleSearch < Raif::ModelTool
  # For example tool implementations, see: 
  # Wikipedia Search Tool: https://github.com/CultivateLabs/raif/blob/main/app/models/raif/model_tools/wikipedia_search.rb
  # Fetch URL Tool: https://github.com/CultivateLabs/raif/blob/main/app/models/raif/model_tools/fetch_url.rb

  # Define the schema for the arguments that the LLM should use when invoking your tool.
  # It should be a valid JSON schema. When the model invokes your tool,
  # the arguments it provides will be validated against this schema using JSON::Validator from the json-schema gem.
  #
  # All attributes will be required and additionalProperties will be set to false.
  #
  # This schema would expect the model to invoke your tool with an arguments JSON object like:
  # { "query" : "some query here" }
  tool_arguments_schema do
    string :query, description: "The query to search for"
  end

  # An example of how the LLM should invoke your tool. This should return a hash with name and arguments keys.
  # `to_json` will be called on it and provided to the LLM as an example of how to invoke your tool.
  example_model_invocation do
    {
      "name": tool_name,
      "arguments": { "query": "example query here" }
    }
  end

  tool_description do
    "Description of your tool that will be provided to the LLM so it knows when to invoke it"
  end

  # When your tool is invoked by the LLM in a Raif::Agent loop, 
  # the results of the tool invocation are provided back to the LLM as an observation.
  # This method should return whatever you want provided to the LLM.
  # For example, if you were implementing a GoogleSearch tool, this might return a JSON
  # object containing search results for the query.
  def self.observation_for_invocation(tool_invocation)
    return "No results found" unless tool_invocation.result.present?

    JSON.pretty_generate(tool_invocation.result)
  end

  # When the LLM invokes your tool, this method will be called with a `Raif::ModelToolInvocation` record as an argument.
  # It should handle the actual execution of the tool. 
  # For example, if you are implementing a GoogleSearch tool, this method should run the actual search
  # and store the results in the tool_invocation's result JSON column.
  def self.process_invocation(tool_invocation)
    # Extract arguments from tool_invocation.tool_arguments
    # query = tool_invocation.tool_arguments["query"]
    #
    # Process the invocation and perform the desired action
    # ...
    #
    # Store the results in the tool_invocation
    # tool_invocation.update!(
    #   result: {
    #     # Your result data structure
    #   }
    # )
    #
    # Return the result
    # tool_invocation.result
  end

end
```

### Provider-Managed Tools

In addition to the ability to create your own model tools, Raif supports provider-managed tools. These are tools that are built into certain LLM providers and run on the provider's infrastructure:

- **`Raif::ModelTools::ProviderManaged::WebSearch`**: Performs real-time web searches and returns relevant results
- **`Raif::ModelTools::ProviderManaged::CodeExecution`**: Executes code in a secure sandboxed environment (e.g. Python)
- **`Raif::ModelTools::ProviderManaged::ImageGeneration`**: Generates images based on text descriptions

Current provider-managed tool support:
| Provider | WebSearch | CodeExecution | ImageGeneration |
|----------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| OpenAI Responses API | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| OpenAI Completions API | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Anthropic Claude | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| AWS Bedrock (Claude) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| OpenRouter | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

To use provider-managed tools, include them in the `available_model_tools` array:

```ruby
# In a conversation
conversation = Raif::Conversation.create!(
  creator: current_user,
  available_model_tools: [
    "Raif::ModelTools::ProviderManaged::WebSearch",
    "Raif::ModelTools::ProviderManaged::CodeExecution"
  ]
)

# In an agent
agent = Raif::Agents::ReActAgent.new(
  task: "Search for recent news about AI and create a summary chart",
  available_model_tools: [
    "Raif::ModelTools::ProviderManaged::WebSearch",
    "Raif::ModelTools::ProviderManaged::CodeExecution"
  ],
  creator: current_user
)

# Directly in a chat
llm = Raif.llm(:open_ai_responses_gpt_4_1)
model_completion = llm.chat(
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What are the latest developments in Ruby on Rails?" }], 
  available_model_tools: [Raif::ModelTools::ProviderManaged::WebSearch]
)
```

## Sending Images/Files/PDF's to the LLM

Raif supports images, files, and PDF's in the messages sent to the LLM.

To include an image, file/PDF in a message, you can use the `Raif::ModelImageInput` and `Raif::ModelFileInput`.

To include an image:
```ruby
# From a local file
image = Raif::ModelImageInput.new(input: "path/to/image.png")

# From a URL
image = Raif::ModelImageInput.new(url: "https://example.com/image.png")

# From an ActiveStorage attachment (assumes you have a User model with an avatar attachment)
image = Raif::ModelImageInput.new(input: user.avatar)

# Then chat with the LLM
llm = Raif.llm(:open_ai_gpt_4o)
model_completion = llm.chat(messages: [
  { role: "user", content: ["What's in this image?", image]}
])
```

To include a file/PDF:
```ruby
# From a local file
file = Raif::ModelFileInput.new(input: "path/to/file.pdf")

# From a URL
file = Raif::ModelFileInput.new(url: "https://example.com/file.pdf")

# From an ActiveStorage attachment (assumes you have a Document model with a pdf attachment)
file = Raif::ModelFileInput.new(input: document.pdf)

# Then chat with the LLM
llm = Raif.llm(:open_ai_gpt_4o)
model_completion = llm.chat(messages: [
  { role: "user", content: ["What's in this file?", file]}
])
```

### Images/Files/PDF's in Tasks

You can include images and files/PDF's when running a `Raif::Task`:

To include a file/PDF:
```ruby
file = Raif::ModelFileInput.new(input: "path/to/file.pdf")

# Assumes you've created a PdfContentExtraction task
task = Raif::Tasks::PdfContentExtraction.run(
  creator: current_user,
  files: [file]
)
```

To include an image:
```ruby
image = Raif::ModelImageInput.new(input: "path/to/image.png")

# Assumes you've created a ImageDescriptionGeneration task
task = Raif::Tasks::ImageDescriptionGeneration.run(
  creator: current_user,
  images: [image]
)
```


# Embedding Models

Raif supports generation of vector embeddings. You can enable and configure embedding models in your Raif configuration:

```ruby
Raif.configure do |config|
  config.open_ai_embedding_models_enabled = true
  config.bedrock_embedding_models_enabled = true
  
  config.default_embedding_model_key = "open_ai_text_embedding_3_small"
end
```

## Supported Embedding Models

Raif currently supports the following embedding models:

### OpenAI
- `open_ai_text_embedding_3_small`
- `open_ai_text_embed ding_3_large`
- `open_ai_text_embedding_ada_002`

### AWS Bedrock
- `bedrock_titan_embed_text_v2`

## Creating Embeddings

By default, Raif will used `Raif.config.default_embedding_model_key` to create embeddings. To create an embedding for a piece of text:

```ruby
# Generate an embedding for a piece of text
embedding = Raif.generate_embedding!("Your text here")

# Generate an embedding for a piece of text with a specific number of dimensions
embedding = Raif.generate_embedding!("Your text here", dimensions: 1024)

# If you're using an OpenAI embedding model, you can pass an array of strings to embed multiple texts at once
embeddings = Raif.generate_embedding!([
  "Your text here",
  "Your other text here"
])
```

Or to generate embeddings for a piece of text with a specific model:

```ruby
model = Raif.embedding_model(:open_ai_text_embedding_3_small)
embedding = model.generate_embedding!("Your text here")
```

# Web Admin

Raif includes a web admin interface for viewing all interactions with the LLM. Assuming you have the engine mounted at `/raif`, you can access the admin interface at `/raif/admin`.

The admin interface contains sections for:
- Model Completions
- Tasks
- Conversations
- Agents
- Model Tool Invocations
- Stats

# Customization

## Controllers

You can override Raif's controllers by creating your own that inherit from Raif's base controllers:

```ruby
class ConversationsController < Raif::ConversationsController
  # Your customizations here
end

class ConversationEntriesController < Raif::ConversationEntriesController
  # Your customizations here
end
```

Then update the configuration:
```ruby
Raif.configure do |config|
  config.conversations_controller = "ConversationsController"
  config.conversation_entries_controller = "ConversationEntriesController"
end
```

## Models

By default, Raif models inherit from `ApplicationRecord`. You can change this:

```ruby
Raif.configure do |config|
  config.model_superclass = "CustomRecord"
end
```

## Views

You can customize Raif's views by copying them to your application and modifying them. To copy the conversation-related views, run:

```bash
rails generate raif:views
```

This will copy all conversation and conversation entry views to your application in:
- `app/views/raif/conversations/`
- `app/views/raif/conversation_entries/`

These views will automatically override Raif's default views. You can customize them to match your application's look and feel while maintaining the same functionality.

## System Prompts

If you don't want to override the system prompt entirely in your task/conversation subclasses, you can customize the intro portion of the system prompts for conversations and tasks:

```ruby
Raif.configure do |config|
  config.conversation_system_prompt_intro = "You are a helpful assistant who specializes in customer support."
  config.task_system_prompt_intro = "You are a helpful assistant who specializes in data analysis."
  # or with a lambda
  config.task_system_prompt_intro = ->(task) { "You are a helpful assistant who specializes in #{task.name}." }
  config.conversation_system_prompt_intro = ->(conversation) { "You are a helpful assistant talking to #{conversation.creator.email}. Today's date is #{Date.today.strftime('%B %d, %Y')}." }
end
```

## Adding LLM Models

You can easily add new LLM models to Raif:

```ruby
# Register the model in Raif's LLM registry
Raif.register_llm(Raif::Llms::OpenRouter, {
  key: :open_router_gemini_flash_1_5_8b, # a unique key for the model
  api_name: "google/gemini-flash-1.5-8b", # name of the model to be used in API calls - needs to match the provider's API name
  input_token_cost: 0.038 / 1_000_000, # the cost per input token
  output_token_cost: 0.15 / 1_000_000, # the cost per output token
})

# Then use the model
llm = Raif.llm(:open_router_gemini_flash_1_5_8b)
llm.chat(message: "Hello, world!")

# Or set it as the default LLM model in your initializer
Raif.configure do |config|
  config.default_llm_model_key = "open_router_gemini_flash_1_5_8b"
end
```

# Testing

Raif includes RSpec helpers and FactoryBot factories to help with testing in your application.

To use the helpers, add the following to your `rails_helper.rb`:

```ruby
require "raif/rspec"

RSpec.configure do |config|
  config.include Raif::RspecHelpers
end
```

You can then use the helpers to stub LLM calls:

```ruby
it "stubs a document summarization task" do
  # the messages argument is the array of messages sent to the LLM. It will look something like:
  # [{"role" => "user", "content" => "The prompt from the Raif::Tasks::DocumentSummarization task" }]
  # The model_completion argument is the Raif::ModelCompletion record that was created for this task.
  stub_raif_task(Raif::Tasks::DocumentSummarization) do |messages, model_completion|
    "Stub out the response from the LLM"
  end

  user = FactoryBot.create(:user) # assumes you have a User model & factory
  document = FactoryBot.create(:document) # assumes you have a Document model & factory
  task = Raif::Tasks::DocumentSummarization.run(document: document, creator: user)

  expect(task.raw_response).to eq("Stub out the response from the LLM")
end

it "stubs a conversation" do
  user = FactoryBot.create(:user) # assumes you have a User model & factory
  conversation = FactoryBot.create(:raif_test_conversation, creator: user)
  conversation_entry = FactoryBot.create(:raif_conversation_entry, raif_conversation: conversation, creator: user)

  stub_raif_conversation(conversation) do |messages, model_completion|
    "Hello"
  end

  conversation_entry.process_entry!
  expect(conversation_entry.reload).to be_completed
  expect(conversation_entry.model_response_message).to eq("Hello")
end

it "stubs an agent" do
  i = 0
  stub_raif_agent(agent) do |messages, model_completion|
    i += 1
    if i == 1
      "<thought>I need to search.</thought>\n<action>{\"tool\": \"wikipedia_search\", \"arguments\": {\"query\": \"capital of France\"}}</action>"
    else
      "<thought>Now I know.</thought>\n<answer>Paris</answer>"
    end
  end
end
```

Raif also provides FactoryBot factories for its models. You can use them to create Raif models for testing. If you're using `factory_bot_rails`, they will be added automatically to `config.factory_bot.definition_file_paths`. The available factories can be found [here](https://github.com/CultivateLabs/raif/tree/main/spec/factories/shared).

# Demo App

Raif includes a [demo app](https://github.com/CultivateLabs/raif_demo) that you can use to see the engine in action. Assuming you have Ruby 3.4.2 and Postgres installed, you can run the demo app with:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CultivateLabs/raif_demo.git
cd raif_demo
bundle install
bin/rails db:create db:prepare
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here bin/rails s
```

You can then access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
